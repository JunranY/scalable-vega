# 08/22/2019 - 08/28/2019
## Goals for this week
* [ ] Compile Vega lite gallery specs to Vega to see how much more complex the Vega specs are.
* [ ] Run scalable vega demo + postgres transform on another dataset, with another encoding besides barchart.

## Accomplishments
* Compiled 9 Vega lite gallery specs to Vega. It seems the Vega specs are substantially more complex, being roughly 
  8x longer (in terms of line count).
* Extended scalable vega demo with a file selector to choose the vega spec to run. Tested with cars.json (barchart)
  and flights.json (scatterplot). Everything works.

## Challenges (problems/issues/questions that need to be addressed)
* No blockers this week.

## Additional Notes
* Working (manually) with the Vega specs is a bit difficult and error prone. For example, field identifiers need to be
  duplicated in many properties/sub-properties of the JSON. Generating JSON specs with code that uses variables per field can
  mitigate this.
